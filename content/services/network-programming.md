Nowadays, with everything from cars to earbuds being labeled as "smart" and connected to the Internet, network programming has become essential. The OSI model, a fundamental framework for networking developed in the 1970s, remains largely unchanged. 

We've mastered the seven layers of this model, ensuring that we can develop network software capable of operating securely and efficiently at each level. Whether it involves Ethernet, IPv4/IPv6, UDP, TCP, HTTPS, or QUIC, we can handle data transmission from point A to point B without issue.
