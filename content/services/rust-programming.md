When resources are tight, or you need to squeeze every bit of performance out of CPUs, RAM, and disk space, [Rust](https://rust-lang.org "Rust language website") is the answer. For years, it has challenged C and C++ as the choice when writing systems-level services such as operating systems, embedded devices, and mission-critical services.
