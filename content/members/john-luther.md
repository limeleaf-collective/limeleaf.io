John started his career at RSA Security working on 2FA and cryptographic
SDK products. In 2002 he joined On2 Technologies to manage the company’s
proprietary video codec products, which were used by billions of users
in Adobe Flash, Skype, and JavaFX. After Google acquired On2, he was the
product leader for HTML5 video in Google Chrome and led the WebM Project
(now the Alliance for Open Media) to develop the VP9 and AV1 open video
codecs.

John joined JW Player in 2014 and led several product teams there before
taking over JW Platform and growing it into a leading SaaS video
platform with over a billion monthly active users worldwide. He founded
Limeleaf with Blain and Erik in 2024.
