We provide [Staff-level](https://staffeng.com/guides/what-do-staff-engineers-actually-do/ "What do Staff+ engineers actually do?") software engineering and product development services to build systems that work.

Our team members have decades of collective experience in every facet of building software. We've worked at [Google][2], [Electronic Arts][3], [ngrok][4], [Kinetic][5], [Harvard University][6], [RSA Security][8], [JW Player][7], and elsewhere creating web APIs, video services, publishing platforms, IoT devices, and much more.

Whether you need to develop a new application or integrate with 3rd-party services, Limeleaf has the expertise, experience, and innovative spirit to get it done.
