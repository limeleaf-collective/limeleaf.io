## Team Extension

Limeleaf can provide specialized experts to augment your team for almost any tech project. We do engagements on a monthly basis, with a minimum engagement length of three months. The price depends on the nature and complexity of the project. [Write to us](https://limeleaf.io/contact/ "Contact us") to discuss your project and get a quote.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development

We can build you an MVP, but weâ€™d rather build you an [SLC (Simple, Loveable, and Complete)](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/ "Your customers hate MVPs. Make a SLC instead.").

We'll work with you to build your SLC within a fixed time frame and for a fixed price. When the SLC is complete, you can extend the package to develop the product further.

The package includes:

- Product and engineering time and expertise of all the Limeleaf founders
- Weekly requirement review and project planning sessions
- Weekly feature demo, 30-minute progress meeting, and email report
- Access to Limeleaf project management software so you have visibility into the work
- Free demo hosting of your SLC during development
- Deployment of the final SLC on your infrastructure
- Unlimited email communications with a 12-hour guaranteed response time

2. **Price quote.** Estimate the months required to do the work and the monthly rate.
3. **Signed contract.**
4. **Business requirements workshop.** Identify the business problems your SLC solves and its critical functionality.
5. **Product requirements.** Prioritize core features, define architecture/tech stack, set milestones, and write user stories.
6. **Wireframes.** Develop basic functional UI design (if you want a more advanced UI, we can work with your designer).
7. **Software development.** Coding and testing.
8. **Final MVP deployed to your infrastructure.**
