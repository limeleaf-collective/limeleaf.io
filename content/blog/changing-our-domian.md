This morning, [Blain](/members/blain-smith/ "Blain Smith") educated me about the [history of the .io top-level domain](https://tamouse.github.io/blog/politics/2019/10/02/why-is-the-io-domain-problematic.html "Why is the .io domain problematic?"). I didn't know that history when I bought limeleaf.net last year before teaming up with Blain and Erik. 

limeleaf.net wasn't available then, but to my surprise and delight, it was this morning, so I bought it. 

All Limeleaf site traffic and email now redirect from limeleaf.io to limeleaf.net, and I have donated $50 to [Chagossian Voices](https://chagossianvoices.org/).
