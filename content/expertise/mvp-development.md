We understand the importance of bringing your product to market quickly and efficiently, so we offer a unique service to help you build your Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which we prefer to call Simple, Lean, and Concise (SLC) solutions ([learn about the difference](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/ "What is Simple, Lean, and Concise (SLC)?")).

Our team of staff-level developers and product managers will collaborate closely with you to understand your vision and goals, ensuring we create an SLC that validates your idea in the market.

## Predictable Costs

We operate on a fixed-time / fixed-price basis for [SLC](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/ "What is Simple, Lean, and Concise (SLC)?") development. This provides cost predictability, allowing you to plan your resources effectively while eliminating surprises or hidden costs.

## Your Long-Term Development Partners

Once the [SLC](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/ "What is Simple, Lean, and Concise (SLC)?") is complete, you can extend the package to develop the product further. Whether you want to add new features, improve the user interface, optimize performance, or scale your product, our team will be ready to support you in the next phase of your product's growth.

**Our SLC package includes:**

- Product and engineering time and expertise of all the Limeleaf founders
- Weekly requirement review and project planning sessions
- Weekly feature demo, 30-minute progress meeting, and email report
- Access to Limeleaf project management software so you have visibility into the work
- Free demo hosting of your [SLC](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/ "What is Simple, Lean, and Concise (SLC)?") during development
- Deployment of the final [SLC](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/ "What is Simple, Lean, and Concise (SLC)?") on your infrastructure
- Unlimited email communications with a 12-hour guaranteed response time
