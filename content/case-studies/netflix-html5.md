**Problem:** Chrome users wanted to stream Netflix, but Microsoft discontinued Silverlight video+DRM plugin.

**Solution:** Created HTML5 APIs for DRM and adaptive streaming; developed Widevine DRM module for Chrome.

**Results:** Launched app with Netflix at Google I/O; every major streaming service has since adopted the tech.
