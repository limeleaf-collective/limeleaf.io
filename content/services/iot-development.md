IoT devices like smartwatches, thermostats, fridges, and coffee makers have become part of our daily lives. These devices are basically small, programmable computers that need to be especially reliable, secure, and stable since they often can't easily be reset or directly accessed. They might lose power or connectivity without warning.

### Deep Expertise in IoT

Our experience designing IoT systems ensures that your devices are securely set up using robust methods such as mTLS and private key infrastructure (PKI). We can enable bidirectional communication and support data streaming using protocols like MQTT, NATS, WebSockets, or  TCP. We also know how to handle low-level communications through GPIO, I2C, and serial connections.

### IoT Requires Special Skills

Since many IoT devices run on batteries, understanding the hardware is crucial to optimizing performance and energy efficiency. We write code that maximizes the work done per CPU cycle to prevent quick battery drain.

Let us guide you through the complexities of IoT technology to bring your product concept to your customers effectively.

### Rust Programming

When resources are tight, or you need to squeeze every bit of performance out of CPUs, RAM, and disk space, Rust is the answer. For years, it has challenged C and C++ as the choice when writing systems-level services such as operating systems, embedded devices, and mission-critical services. 

Rust's memory management and guarantee of memory safety make it the perfect choice for us to work on your next embedded or IoT project.
