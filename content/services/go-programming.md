Go is known for being used for some of the most popular cloud-based and network-connected software and by some of the biggest infrastructure providers in the world. Its focus on simplicity, correctness, concurrency support, and “batteries-included” standard library make it the ideal choice when building any network-connected software system. 

We have been using Go for over 10 years, have given talks in the community, and consider ourselves language experts. We know how to leverage Go’s features to build performant, scalable, and stable network services for any industry.
